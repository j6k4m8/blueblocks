Blueblocks is a word game where you build the smallest word grid possible. When you start a new game, you are given a set of 16 letter tiles. You must place these tiles on a grid so that all horizontal and vertical words are valid. When all tiles are placed, your score is the number of tiles enclosed by the smallest rectangle that contains all tiles. The goal is to get the smallest score possible.

The game server is written in Python and uses the Flask framework. The client is written in JavaScript and p5.js.

The word list is managed by https://github.com/fogleman/TWL06/blob/master/twl.py
